# Titanic-Classification

#Project Summary
This data science project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. This dataset provides information about passengers' attributes such as age, gender, class, and more, allowing us to analyze patterns and build a model to predict survival.

#Objectives
1.Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and gain insights into the dataset.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize or scale numerical features to prepare the data for model training.

3.Feature Engineering: Create new features that might improve the predictive power of the model.

4.Model Building: Train machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers based on their attributes. Experiment with different algorithms and ensemble methods.

5.Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6.Results Interpretation: Present and interpret the results, highlighting the most significant features influencing survival predictions.

#Project Structure
1.Data: The dataset is stored in CSV format, with separate files for training and testing data.

2.Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are used for different stages of the project, including EDA, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

3.Source Code: Python scripts containing functions and classes for data processing and model building.

4.Models: Saved machine learning models after training.

#Tools and Technologies
1.Programming Language: Python

2.Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

3.Development Environment:  Google Colab Notebook
